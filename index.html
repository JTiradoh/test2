    <h3>Visit the Ghibli Museum</h3>
    <p>Studio Ghibli, co-founded by directors Miyazaki Hayao and Takahata Isao, is consistently responsible for Japan's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful animated films – a rare combination. It's also responsible for turning out a whole generation of Japanophiles – those who fell in love with films like Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984), My Neighbor Totoro (1988) and Spirited Away (2001).</p>
    <p>The Ghibli Museum captures the spirit of wonder that makes the films so enchanting, and several beloved characters are worked into the design. There's also a small cinema here that screens original shorts directed by Miyazaki, Takahata and their protégés. Check the website for regular updates on what’s available.</p>
    <p>Naturally, the museum has an excellent gift shop.</p>

<h3>Make a pilgrimage to the original Mandarake Complex
</h3>

  <p>Mandarake Complex is a hugely important shop in the anime, manga and gamer universe. What started as a small used comic-book store in the 1980s has since grown into a national franchise. But while the new shops might be bigger (and easier to navigate) there's nothing like the original shop in Nakano.</p>
  <p>'Shops', we should say: the original Mandarake is inside a vintage 1960's shopping centre, Nakano Broadway. When it outgrew this space, it didn't move to a new location; it just took over more shops in the mall. The total now hovers around 25 – a significant chunk of the mall's real estate. Each is highly specific, carrying just items like production cels from animated films, or vintage toys or rare manga. The combination of faded mid-20th century mall architecture and Mandarake's somewhat mecha (mechanical) aesthetic gives the whole place an appropriately post-apocalyptic vibe.</p>
  <p>There are other branches in Akihabara, Ikebukuro (this one is popular with fan girls) and Shibuya.</p>
